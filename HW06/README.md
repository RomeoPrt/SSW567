# **Assignment 6: Practice with Orthogonal Arrays**
The purpose of this assignment is to get you to practice using orthogonal arrays.   There are four parts to this assignment.  Submit answers to all 4 parts.

Youâ€™ll find Orthogonal Arrays on a variety of websites including http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/tables/orthogonal.htmLinks to an external site.

## **Part 1:**
The Software Engineering Department at Stevens Institute of Technology is launching a new website to help students plan their class schedules.   We need to support the following configurations:

Operating System: Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows 10
{OSX, Linux, Win10}
Browser: Safari, Firefox, and Chrome
Note: Safari, Firefox, and Chrome are available on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows 10
{Safari, Firefox, Chrome}
Student Type: Undergraduate and Graduate
{U,G|
Student Location: On Campus or Remote
{C,R}

**Answer these questions:**

1. What is the total number of test cases for exhaustive testing?  Show the exhaustive list of all combinations.
2. What are the factors and levels for each factor?
3. How many test cases do we need for Pairwise Orthogonal Array Testing?
4. Select and show the proper Orthogonal Array
5. Populate and show the Orthogonal Array with the appropriate values for this problem

## **Part 2:**
You are selling a bicycle store support application. It has the following configuration options: 
1) On-line sales or retail in-store
2) USA or Canada stores
3) Payment by Visa or American Express Only (no cash)
4) Selling bicycles only or doing maintenance and sales

**Answer these questions:**

1. How many combinations of these 4 variables are there?
2. How many tests do you need to cover all combinations of any one variable?
3. What is the orthogonal array which you can use for this problem?  How many test cases does it represent?
4. If you had 7 variables with 2 values each, which array would you use?
5. How many test cases does an L8 array represent?
 
## **Part 3:**
Your company provides online books for various readers. The ones you need to worry about are Kindle, iPad and Zok. There are 4 different classes of books you need to worry about - textbooks (which have lots of equations), poetry (where the formatting is extremely important), graphic novels, and regular novels. They also can be ordered in three different languages, English, Spanish, and Japanese. 

**Answer these questions:**

1. What is the total number of test cases for all combinations?
2. What  is the minimum number of tests for pairwise testing? (this is a simple calculation). 
3. You decide to use orthogonal arrays to help with your testing. Which table should you use?

## **Part 4:**
We need to do some configuration testing on a new version of an application.There are 5 different operating systems we need to test on, 3 different browsers, and 3 different languages (English, Spanish, and Martian)

**Answer these questions:**

1. How many combinations are there of these variables? 
2. Which orthogonal array should you use?
3. How many individual tests do you need to run for all combinations of two variables? (Not the minimum number of tests for any pair of variables)
